    quote, source

Filling in the divs

Header: logo left, three links right with no deco
Hero: H1, subtext, sign up button to the left. Placeholder image to the right.
Information: contains four boxes with rounded corners and about three lines of text below them.
Quotebox just has text but the source of the queote is outlined to the right. Needs its own class.

Two approaches

- one div at a time. After it works, move on to the next one.
- Build all divs, then fuck around with flexbox until they do what you want...

NOTES

- I could have / should have
